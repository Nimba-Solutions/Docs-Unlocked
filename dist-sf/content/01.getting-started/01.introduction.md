### Runtime Navigation Discovery

Docs Unlocked automatically discovers your content structure at runtime. Simply organize your markdown files in directories, and navigation is generated automatically. No manual configuration needed!

## Quick Start

1. **Deploy to Salesforce**
   ```bash
   npm run build:sf
   cci task run deploy --path force-app --org dev
   ```

2. **Add your content** - Place markdown files in `public/content/` with numerical prefixes for ordering

3. **Enjoy!** - Navigation is automatically generated from your file structure
