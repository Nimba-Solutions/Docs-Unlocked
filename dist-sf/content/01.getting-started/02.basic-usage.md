# Basic Usage

Learn how to write markdown content and organize your documentation for Docs Unlocked.

## Content Organization

Docs Unlocked uses markdown files organized in folders. You can either let Docs Unlocked automatically generate navigation from your file structure, or provide a manual `manifest.yaml` file for full control.

### Directory Structure

Organize your content like this:

```plaintext
content/
├── 01.getting-started/
│   ├── 01.introduction.md
│   └── 02.basic-usage.md
├── 02.core-concepts/
│   ├── 01.configuration.md
│   └── 02.advanced-topics.md
└── 03.api-reference/
    └── 01.overview.md
```

**Key Points:**
- Use numeric prefixes (`01.`, `02.`, etc.) for ordering
- Prefixes are automatically stripped from display names
- Each folder becomes a navigation section
- Each `.md` file becomes a page

### Automatic vs Manual Navigation

Docs Unlocked supports two approaches:

#### Automatic Navigation (Recommended)

**No manifest file needed!** Just organize files with numeric prefixes:

```plaintext
content/
├── 01.getting-started/
│   ├── 01.introduction.md    # Title extracted from H1 header
│   └── 02.basic-usage.md
```

**How it works:**
- Docs Unlocked scans your ZIP file structure using Apex
- Extracts titles from the first H1 header (`# Title`) in each markdown file
- If no H1 found, generates title from filename (e.g., `basic-usage` → "Basic Usage")
- Removes numeric prefixes from section and page names
- Sorts everything by numeric prefixes

**Benefits:**
- Zero configuration - just organize files
- Less maintenance - add files, they appear automatically
- Consistent ordering via numeric prefixes

#### Manual Manifest File (Optional)

Create `manifest.yaml` for complete control:

```yaml
getting-started:
  - title: Introduction
    file: getting-started/introduction.md
    path: /getting-started/introduction
  - title: Quick Start Guide
    file: getting-started/quick-start.md
    path: /getting-started/quick-start
core-concepts:
  - title: Configuration
    file: core-concepts/configuration.md
    path: /core-concepts/configuration
```

**When to use:**
- Need custom titles that don't match H1 headers
- Want to exclude certain files from navigation
- Need to reorder pages differently than file naming
- Want to add descriptions or metadata

### The Manifest File (Optional)

If you choose to create `manifest.yaml`, place it inside your `content/` folder.

**Example `manifest.yaml`:**

```yaml
getting-started:
  - title: Introduction
    file: getting-started/introduction.md
    path: /getting-started/introduction
  - title: Quick Start
    file: getting-started/quick-start.md
    path: /getting-started/quick-start
core-concepts:
  - title: Configuration
    file: core-concepts/configuration.md
    path: /core-concepts/configuration
```

### Manifest Structure

Each section in the manifest has:
- **Section name** (e.g., `getting-started`) - becomes the sidebar section title
- **Array of pages** - each page has:
  - `title` - Display name in navigation
  - `file` - Path to the markdown file (relative to `content/` folder)
  - `path` - URL path (used for links and navigation)

**Important Notes:**
- Section names are converted to titles (e.g., `getting-started` → "Getting Started")
- File paths are relative to the `content/` folder
- Paths should start with `/` and match the section/page structure
- Order matters - pages appear in the order listed in the manifest
- If `manifest.yaml` exists, it takes precedence over automatic generation

## Writing Markdown

Docs Unlocked supports full GitHub Flavored Markdown. Here's how to write your content:

### Headers

```markdown
# H1 Header (Page Title)
## H2 Header (Section)
### H3 Header (Subsection)
#### H4 Header
```

**Rendered:**

# H1 Header (Page Title)
## H2 Header (Section)
### H3 Header (Subsection)
#### H4 Header

**Tip**: The first H1 (`#`) in your file becomes the page title in navigation (when using automatic mode).

### Text Formatting

```markdown
- **Bold text** with `**bold**` or `__bold__`
- *Italic text* with `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ with `~~strikethrough~~`
- `Inline code` with backticks
```

**Rendered:**
- **Bold text** with `**bold**` or `__bold__`

- `Inline code` with backticks

### Lists

**Unordered Lists:**
```markdown
- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
```

**Rendered:**
- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

**Ordered Lists:**
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item

### Callouts

Docs Unlocked supports GitHub-style callouts:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note callout.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip callout.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an important callout.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning callout.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution callout.
```

**Rendered:**

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note callout.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip callout.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an important callout.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning callout.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution callout.

### Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a blockquote. Use it for important notes, warnings, or callouts.
>
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote.
```

**Rendered:**

> This is a blockquote. Use it for important notes, warnings, or callouts.
>
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote.

### Links

**Internal Links** (to other pages):
```markdown
[Go to Configuration](/core-concepts/configuration)
[See Contributing Guide](/getting-started/contributing)
```

**Rendered:**
[Go to Configuration](/core-concepts/configuration)
[See Contributing Guide](/getting-started/contributing)

**External Links:**
```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com)
[Link with Title](https://example.com "Example Website")
```

**Rendered:**
[GitHub](https://github.com)
[Link with Title](https://example.com "Example Website")

**Important**: Internal links should use paths from your manifest or automatic navigation (without the `.md` extension).

### Images

Images are loaded from your StaticResource. Place images in a `media/` folder:

```markdown
![Alt text](/media/logo.png)
![Screenshot](/media/app-overview.png "App Overview")
```

**Path Resolution:**
- Images in `media/` folder: Use `/media/filename.jpg`
- Example: `![Logo](/media/logo.png)` loads from `/resource/docsContent/media/logo.png`
- Absolute URLs (http/https) work as-is

**Supported Formats:**
- PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP

**Example:**

![Flan dessert](/media/flan-612x612.jpg "Delicious flan")
> ... flan is awesome.

### Videos

Videos are automatically embedded when you use image syntax with a video file extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to Salesforce's 5MB StaticResource size limit, videos must be hosted externally (Salesforce Files or public URLs).

**External URLs:**
```markdown
![Demo Video](https://your-domain.com/videos/demo.mp4)
![Tutorial](https://example.com/tutorial.webm "How to use the app")
```

**Salesforce Files:**
```markdown
![Salesforce Video](https://yourinstance.salesforce.com/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/068XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)
```

**Supported Formats:**
- MP4, WebM, OGG, MOV, AVI, WMV, FLV, MKV

**Note:** If you use a relative path (e.g., `/media/video.mp4`), a warning message will be displayed instead of the video, as StaticResources cannot exceed 5MB. Always use absolute URLs for videos.

**Video Embedding Services:**

You can embed videos from YouTube, Vimeo, etc. by using their watch URLs:

```markdown
![Video Title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)
![Vimeo Video](https://vimeo.com/VIDEO_ID)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For external video services to work, your Salesforce admin must configure [Remote Site Settings](lightning/setup/SecurityRemoteProxy/home) to allow requests to the video service's domain (e.g., `www.youtube.com`, `player.vimeo.com`).

**Example:**

```markdown
![External Video](https://example.com/video.mp4 "Example video")
![YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WAOxKOmR90)
```

![YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WAOxKOmR90)

### Navigation Cards

Use the `:::navcards` block to create card-based navigation. These are rendered as interactive cards:

```markdown
:::navcards
title: Configuration
description: Go beyond the basics
href: /core-concepts/configuration
---
title: Contributing
description: We welcome your ideas for improving this tool!
href: /getting-started/contributing
:::
```

:::navcards
title: Configuration
description: Go beyond the basics
href: /core-concepts/configuration
---
title: Contributing
description: We welcome your ideas for improving this tool!
href: /getting-started/contributing
:::

**Note:** Navigation cards inside code blocks (like in this example) are not processed - they display as code. Only cards outside code blocks are rendered.

## File Naming Best Practices

### For Automatic Navigation

When using automatic navigation (no manifest file):

1. **Use numeric prefixes for ordering:**
   - Folders: `01.getting-started`, `02.core-concepts`, `03.api-reference`
   - Files: `01.introduction.md`, `02.basic-usage.md`

2. **Use descriptive names:**
   - Good: `01.getting-started`, `02.api-authentication`
   - Avoid: `01.section1`, `02.section2`

3. **Use lowercase with hyphens:**
   - Good: `basic-usage.md`, `api-reference.md`
   - Avoid: `BasicUsage.md`, `API_Reference.md`

4. **Include H1 headers in files:**
   - The first `# Title` becomes the page title
   - If no H1 found, title is generated from filename

### For Manual Manifest

When using `manifest.yaml`, you have more flexibility:

- File names can be anything
- Titles are explicitly defined in manifest
- Order is controlled by manifest order
- Can exclude files from navigation

## Packaging Your Content

### Step 1: Organize Files

Make sure your structure looks like this:

```plaintext
docs-content/
├── content/
│   ├── manifest.yaml          (optional)
│   ├── 01.getting-started/
│   │   ├── 01.introduction.md
│   │   └── 02.basic-usage.md
│   └── 02.core-concepts/
│       └── 01.configuration.md
└── media/                     (optional)
    └── logo.png
```

### Step 2: Create ZIP File

1. Select the `content/` folder and `media/` folder (if you have media)
2. Create a ZIP file containing both folders
3. If using manual mode, ensure `manifest.yaml` is inside the `content/` folder

**Important**: The ZIP should contain `content/` and `media/` at the root level, not nested inside another folder.

### Step 3: Upload to Salesforce

1. Go to [**Setup** → **Custom Code** → **Static Resources**](lightning/setup/StaticResources/home)
2. Click **New** (or edit existing)
3. **Name**: `docsContent` (or your preferred name)
4. **File**: Upload your ZIP file
5. **Cache Control**: Select **Public**
6. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Update Component

1. Open your Lightning page in App Builder
2. Select the Docs Unlocked component
3. Set **Content Resource Name** to match your StaticResource name
4. Save and activate

## Updating Content

When you need to update your documentation:

1. **Edit markdown files** - Update your content
2. **Update manifest** (if using manual mode) - Add/remove pages or change order
3. **Recreate ZIP** - Package everything again
4. **Upload to Salesforce** - Replace the existing StaticResource
5. **Refresh page** - Users will see updated content (may need to clear cache)

**Tip**: If using automatic navigation, just add new files with proper naming - they'll appear automatically!

## URLs and Deep Linking

Docs Unlocked uses URL hashes for navigation:

- **URL hash** updates as you navigate (e.g., `#/getting-started/introduction`)
- **Deep links** can be shared and bookmarked
- **Anchor links** supported using `#page-path::anchor-id` format

Example URLs:
- `#/getting-started/introduction` - Navigate to a page
- `#/getting-started/introduction::content-organization` - Navigate to a page and scroll to an anchor
